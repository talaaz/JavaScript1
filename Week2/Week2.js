//-12Create an empty object
var emptyObj = {}

//13-Create a function that takes two objects as parameters and compares them. You will actually need to write two functions â€” one that compares with == and one that compares with ===. Remember that objects can have objects inside of them so you'll need to find a way to compare every element of every object (types and values). For example:

var obj1 = {
    a: 1,
    b: 'this is the letter b',
    c: {
        foo: 'what is a foo anyway',
        bar: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    }
}

var obj2 = {
    a: '1',
    b: 'this is the letter b',
    c: {
        foo: 'what is a foo anyway',
        bar: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    }
}

//In our example we'll say that `obj1 == obj2` is `true` and `obj1 === obj2` is `false`. Make sure you can see why before you write any code!

function objectsTaskTrue(obj1, obj2) {
    if (obj1 == obj2) {
        return true;
    }
}

function objectsTaskfalse(obj1, obj2) {
    if (obj1 === obj2) {
        return false;
    }
}

//14-We saw that we can pass functions as arguments to other functions. Your task is to write a function that takes another function as an argument and runs it.

function foo(func) {
    return bar; //maybe ?
}

function bar() {
    console.log('Hello, I am bar!');
}

foo(bar);

//15Write some code to test two arrays for equality using == and ===. Test the following:What do you think will happen with x == y, x === y and z == y and z == x? Prove it!

var x = [1, 2, 3];
var y = [1, 2, 3];
var z = y;


x == y; //flase
x === y; //false
z == y; //true
z == x; //false



//16- Take a look at the following code:

var o1 = {
    foo: 'bar'
};
var o2 = {
    foo: 'bar'
};
var o3 = o2;

o2 = {
    foo: 'not bar'
};
console.log(o3); //did not change
Show that changing `o2`
changes `o3` (or not) and changing~~`o2`
changes `o3`~~`o1`
changes `o3` (or not).

Does the order that you assign(`o3 = o2`
    or `o2 = o3`) matter ? {
    Jim Cramer: ? ? ?
}

//17-What does the following code return? (And why?)

let bar = 42;
typeof typeof bar;
//string typeof returns a string, of the type of the value you provided,
//When you check the value returned by typeof, it will be in string form, like:
